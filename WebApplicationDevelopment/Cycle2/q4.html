    <h1>Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple</h1>
    <div class="description">
      The Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple located in <br>Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. It is<br> considered as the richest place of worship in the world. The name of the<br> city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam translates to "The<br> City of Lord Ananta", (The City Of Lord Vishnu) <br>referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate<br> fusion of the Chera style and the MalayalaTamilan style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura.<br> While the Ananthapura temple at Kumbla in Kasaragod is considered as the original seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some<br> extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar.
